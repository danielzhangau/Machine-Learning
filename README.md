# Machine-Learning
UQ COMP

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the development & application of adaptive algorithms that use example data or previous experience to solve a given problem. Topics include: learning problems (e.g regression, classification, unsupervised, reinforcement) & theory, neural networks, statistical & probabilistic models, clustering, ensembles, implementation issues, applications (e.g. bioinformatics, cognitive science, forecasting, robotics, signal & image processing).

# What I learned: 
- Describe the core theoretical and conceptual frameworks that are used in Machine Learning.
-	Explain the properties and functions of a range of different Machine Learning models and to be able to connect a model to appropriate theoretical foundations.
-	Formulate an algorithm that instantiates a given Machine Learning model using appropriate data.
-	Implement Machine Learning algorithms in a high-level programming language.
-	Formulate and execute experiments with implemented Machine Learning techniques on data sets, and to evaluate and reflect on the results.
-	Explain the relationships between the different types of techniques used in Machine Learning and the relationships between Machine Learning and other disciplines.
-	Recognize potential real-world applications of Machine Learning and evaluate the suitability of different Machine Learning technique implementations, algorithms, models and theory for a given application.
